## How Websites Work – Simple Explanation
**1. 🌐 What is a Website?**
A website is just a bunch of files (like text, images, videos) stored on a special computer called a server.

**2. 🧑‍💻 Who Views the Website?**
- You (the person using Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) are called a client or user.
- You want to see a website like www.google.com, so you open your browser and ask the server for that website.

**3. 🔁 How Does the Asking Work?**
Let’s imagine it like sending a letter 📬:
- You = the client
- You write a letter saying: “Hey Google, send me your homepage!”
- You drop this letter in the post office → This is the Internet network (a mix of wires, towers, Wi-Fi, etc.)
- The letter reaches Google’s server.
- Google sends a letter back with the website's content.
- You open it and see the website!

**🎯 Real World Example:**
You type www.amazon.in in your browser → Your device sends a request → Amazon’s server replies → You see Amazon’s homepage.

**4. 🧭 How Do You Know Where to Send the Letter? (IP Address)**
Every device on the internet (your phone, laptop, or server) has an IP address — like a house address.

- 🧑 You have an IP: 123.45.6.78
- 🖥️ Amazon server has an IP: 205.251.242.103
So your device sends a request to that IP, and the server knows where to send the reply.

**🖥️ What is Inside a Server?**
Servers are just computers that:
- Think using a CPU (like your brain doing math)
-  Remember temporary things using RAM (like short-term memory)
-  Store things like images, code, and videos using Storage/Hard Drive
-   Organize data using Databases (like a digital filing cabinet)
-   Connect to internet using Networking hardware (like routers, switches)
-   Think of a server like a brainy robot librarian who can quickly answer questions and send you stuff you asked for.

**What is a Network?**
A network is the system that connects all devices together (like a giant invisible web).
It includes:
- 📦 Routers: Guide your request like GPS
- 🔄 Switches: Send your request to the right computer
- 🌍 Cables/Wi-Fi: Carry your data
- 🎯 Think of it like roads and highways that deliver your message to the right place.

**🏠 How Websites Were Hosted in the Past (Before the Cloud)**
Long ago, if someone wanted to create a website:
- They bought a server computer
- Kept it in their home or garage
- Connected it to the internet
> 💡 Google started in a garage like this!

But as websites grew:
- They needed more servers
- They needed cooling, electricity, rent, maintenance
- They needed people to take care of it all the time
- And it was hard to scale quickly if 100x more people visited!

## ☁️ So What is The Cloud?
The cloud is when companies like Amazon (AWS), Google (GCP), or Microsoft (Azure) rent you servers and resources over the internet.
So you don’t need to:
- Buy your own servers
- Maintain them
- Worry about cooling, power, or space
> 🎯 You just pay for what you use and get computing power on demand — like renting instead of buying!

## What is Cloud Computing?
> Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, 
applications, and other IT resources

- Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
-  Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services
-   mazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application
